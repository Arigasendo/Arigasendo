Hi! I'm Philip. I'm currently studying computer science at Johannes Kepler University.

I'm currently working on a WPF Application for University for Video and Audio Conversion using ffmpeg,
as well as a small for of Wabbajack to make the install of the discontinued Oblivion Modpack WOOL Possible.

I am proficient in Kotlin, Java and C#. My Pick of joice for Web Development is Spring. 
I mainly work in the Backend of Projects, as my frontend skills and design abilities are pretty limited and still have to learn much in that regard.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
